# Time to make our own classes and instances  -  Work in pairs

# 1. Decide on a class to code - ideas: a Superhero, a Bootcamp, a President, a Comedy_show, a Democracy, a Fairytale, a Rocket, a Person etc.
# 2. Code it! - Make sure you include an initialize method with instance variables and instance methods.
# 3. Make a test/interface file where you instantiate your class and test your instance methods.
# 4. Present your classes and objects to us!


# For this, itâ€™s best to make a folder on your desktop or somewhere you can find your folder using your terminal


# mkdir livecode
# cd livecode
# touch name_of_class.rb
# touch test.rb



#  We check in at 5:35pm to have time to present.
